# Introduction
<!-- Background ---------------------------------------------- -->
As shown by Antkare [@Labbe2010IkeAntkare; @Antkare2009ReinforcementLearning], publishing is important.
This example document contains fragments typically used when writing a scientific paper. Please check the [Pandoc User's Guide](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) for more details on *Pandoc-flavored Markdown*.
[@fig:figure_one] is a placeholder.

<!-- ![An image that demonstrates something. This is the SVG version that only works if you have installed Inkscape.](img/placeholder.svg){#fig:figure_one} -->

![An image that demonstrates something. This is the PDF version of the image.](img/placeholder.pdf){#fig:figure_one}

**Note:** Footnotes are useful[^a_footnote]. 
<!-- Putting each sentence on its own line makes editing/reformatting easier. -->

[^a_footnote]: When used sparingly. They are a good place for linking to websites, such as <https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when>.

# Examples

## Apples
Lists are easy:

* a first item
* and a second one with an unrelated footnote[^quickstep]

[^quickstep]: For long URLs, insert manual breaks like this: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B3GfZkwAfHlQE5kAuHcn-wq8I -7D5UF2Ap7C_CYk5co/](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1B3GfZkwAfHlQE5kAuHcn-wq8I-7D5UF2Ap7C_CYk5co/)

## Bananas

Numbered lists:

1. the user always comes first
2. minutes come second
5. now comes the last item. Be aware that Pandoc ignores which numbers you actually place in front!

A small *pseudo-code* listing (which probably should have a caption?)

~~~~
start:
  wait some trime
loop:
  read data 
  if data good:
    print data
  else:
    complain
  goto loop
~~~~


Put two space characters at the end of a line to insert a manual line break.  
Teletype formatting example: ``pandoc --help`` is helpful.

Insert an empty line to start a new paragraph.


# References {.unnumbered}
<!-- add the following lines to correctly format the references section for ACM articles. -->
\footnotesize
\setlength{\parindent}{-0.2in}
\setlength{\leftskip}{0.2in}
\indent
<!-- pandoc appends bibliography here -->
